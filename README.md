# IntonationSentiment
A corpus search for the high-low-high question contour in British English, American English, and Standard German. This project investigates Bob Ladd's (2008) claim that this pitch accent is common and acceptable in British English and German, but rare and regarded as pejorative in American English.

## Corpora
Three corpora are used in this project:
* The Aix-MARSEC (MAchine Readable Spoken English Corpus) database: a compilation of spoken British English conversations, as transcriptions, TextGrids, and audio, from the BBC in the 1980's. Corpus was compiled in 2002-2004.
* The Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English: a large corpus of natural American English conversational speech.
* DIRNDL (Discourse Information Radio News Database for Linguistic Analysis)
