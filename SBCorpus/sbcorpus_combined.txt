179.03 180.03	        	.. And uh we're gonna get into that,
180.03 180.91	        	.. in our discussion.
180.91 181.28	        	.. Alright.
181.28 181.89	        	(H) So,
181.89 185.31	        	.. the whole notion of power is very important ... to understand,
185.31 185.81	        	because,
185.81 187.86	        	here I am making some statements.
187.86 188.33	        	Alright?
188.33 191.41	        	... Some generalities that some people would say are not true=.
191.41 194.54	        	I mean how can (H) Doctor ~Montoya say that Latinos have no=,
194.54 195.48	        	no real power,
195.48 196.20	        	no fear factor,
196.20 196.87	        	After all,
196.87 199.38	        	(H) they have two people that are cabinet members,
199.38 202.12	        	.. they have (H) supervisor here in Los Angeles,
202.12 204.23	        	they have city council people in Los Angeles,
204.23 206.32	        	and yet he's saying that they have no power.
206.32 209.45	        	.. (H) Well power is relative ... as well.
209.45 209.80	        	right?
209.80 210.40	        	.. It's relative.
210.40 211.38	        	It's relational.
211.38 213.05	        	... Power is relational.
213.05 214.92	        	... How can you measure power.
214.92 217.99	        	... Power is impossible to measure.
217.99 218.52	        	... Alright?
218.52 219.42	        	.. In other words,
219.42 221.51	        	you cannot break power apart into vi_ __
221.51 223.14	        	(H) various ingredients,
223.14 224.14	        	.. and say,
224.14 224.75	        	... A,
224.75 225.31	        	... B,
225.31 225.99	        	... C,
225.99 226.33	        	... D,
226.33 227.68	        	these are the ingredients of power.
227.68 229.54	        	(H) .. We can make generalities.
229.54 231.20	        	... Position.
231.20 231.89	        	... Wealth.
231.91 233.52	        	... All these different things that I've talked about.
233.52 235.96	        	(H) But power is difficult to measure.
235.96 237.10	        	... So that,
237.10 239.65	        	.. we must deal with the whole question of empowerment,
239.65 245.01	        	... from also the perspective of potential power (H) versus actual power.
245.01 246.71	        	... There is a difference.
246.71 248.37	        	... If I am,
248.37 249.71	        	... for example,
249.71 253.83	        	... the president (H) .. of .. a major labor union,
253.83 255.32	        	.. or a major corporation.
255.32 257.29	        	... the position,
257.29 259.14	        	.. (H) as president of that entity,
259.14 260.85	        	... gives me so much power.
260.85 265.27	        	... But yet if I do not know how to utili=ze,
265.27 267.55	        	... that entity in terms of its mobilization,
267.72 269.28	        	(H) .. for a given objective,
269.28 270.30	        	.. like a labor union.
270.30 272.38	        	.. If I have fourteen million people as members,
272.38 274.72	        	(H) and I don't show any manifestation of power,
274.72 275.60	        	am I powerful.
275.60 277.00	        	... Well,
277.00 279.86	        	.. it has to be measured by what ... you're trying to do.
279.86 281.21	        	what the objectives are.
281.21 283.49	        	... Example.
283.49 285.26	        	... L=abor today,
285.26 292.30	        	is being challenged by perhaps one of the most ... serious ... pieces ... of __
292.30 294.10	        	... not legislation per se,
294.10 295.78	        	because it's not in a legislative form yet,
295.78 296.50	        	(H) but,
296.50 299.29	        	.. a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement,
299.29 301.58	        	... that if passed by Congress,

311.53 318.24	        	... How is labor today ... mobilizing .. its great power.
318.24 321.73	        	... Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members,
321.73 323.65	        	(H) but the United Auto Workers,

325.47 326.19	        	.. what are they doing.
326.19 328.43	        	.. to influence .. public .. policy.
328.43 329.99	FRANK:  	... Combining power.
329.99 330.64	MONTOYA: 	... Huh?
330.57 331.73	FRANK:  	.. They're combining their power.

341.88 342.37	        	right?
342.37 346.64	        	... Cause .. environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted.
346.64 348.15	        	... especially along the border.
348.19 349.07	        	... Alright,
349.07 349.47	        	.. so there's_,
349.47 351.07	        	.. there's a lot of coalition building.
351.07 353.62	        	... But can you say as a historian,
353.62 357.22	        	... that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago?
357.22 358.25	        	.. Taking [to the] streets?
357.43 357.83	FRANK:  	          [No].
358.25 359.40	        	No they've definitely lost power.
359.40 360.28	MONTOYA: 	... Alright,

937.20 939.18	        	.. Thing I want to underline here,

954.06 954.48	        	Alright?
954.48 957.40	        	... So those two major .. ingredients,
957.40 958.56	        	(H) have molded,

959.73 961.53	        	... that I'm using in this class,
961.53 962.59	        	.. to explain,
962.59 963.73	        	... why is it,
963.73 964.87	        	... that we're still,
964.87 967.07	        	... at the potential phase of empowerment,
967.07 968.36	        	... and we still,
968.36 969.91	        	... have a long ways to go,
969.91 971.45	        	... before we realize,
971.45 973.06	        	.. that concept that I describe,
973.06 974.32	        	... called empowerment.
974.32 978.23	        	... (H) But before we get into that s- .. substance of that,
978.23 979.29	        	(H) is that,
979.29 981.65	        	... I wanna just briefly cover,
981.65 983.22	        	... that,
983.22 985.78	        	... even though,
985.78 987.12	        	.. I'm saying that,
987.12 989.31	        	... Chicanos do not vote in great numbers.
989.31 992.45	        	... And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers.
992.45 994.09	        	(H) The fact is,
994.09 995.57	        	... as I mentioned earlier,
995.57 998.21	        	... that even though we tell the world,
998.21 999.81	        	.. we are this beacon of light,
999.81 1001.27	        	... of freedom,

1004.81 1006.25	        	(H) by and large,
1006.25 1013.97	        	... not ... a lot of people .. participate .. politically .. across the board.
1013.97 1016.17	        	... I don't care if you're African-American,
1016.17 1018.32	        	... I don't care if you're Asian-American,
1018.32 1019.66	        	... and I don't care if you're Latino,
1019.66 1020.63	        	or whatever.
1020.63 1022.19	        	... Most Americans,
1022.19 1023.63	        	... do not vote,
1023.63 1025.17	        	... in great numbers.
1025.17 1026.36	        	... So,
1026.36 1027.59	        	.. it's a double whammy.
1027.59 1029.50	        	... Introducing the subject matter here.
1029.50 1031.06	        	... Americans,
1031.06 1032.89	        	in comparison to Great Britain,
1032.89 1034.42	        	.. in comparison to France,
1034.42 1036.15	        	(H) in comparison to Germany,
1036.15 1037.78	        	.. in comparison to Italy,
1037.78 1038.92	        	... we don't vote,
1038.92 1040.42	        	.. in the numbers that they do.
1040.42 1041.97	        	... Alright?
1041.97 1042.77	        	.. I mean,
1042.77 1043.71	        	if we had more time,
1043.71 1045.71	        	I could give you statistic after statistic,
1045.71 1047.12	        	(H) Italy for example,
1047.12 1049.60	        	ha=s ... a voter .. turnout,
1049.60 1052.13	        	... of ninety percent.

1054.82 1057.21	        	... we're lucky if we get fifty percent.
1057.21 1060.32	        	... Are we .. less democratic?
1060.32 1061.75	        	... Are they more democratic?
1061.75 1063.95	        	... Why is it that Italy has,
1063.95 1065.19	        	(H) a much larger,
1065.19 1067.88	        	.. a higher voter .. level of participation.
1067.88 1070.00	        	... Or Germany.
1070.00 1071.54	        	... Or even Canada.
1071.54 1072.50	        	.. Seventy percent.
1072.50 1074.34	        	... The fact is,
1074.34 1077.43	        	that democracy in this country ... is dying.
1077.43 1080.76	        	... I want you to put that down.
1080.76 1082.27	        	... Cause it's gonna be important.
1082.27 1083.31	        	... At least for my analysis.
1083.31 1084.11	        	I don't want you to agree,
1084.11 1085.10	        	or disagree at this point,
1085.10 1086.01	        	just write it down,
1086.01 1086.96	        	.. (H) you have plenty of time.
1086.96 1088.21	        	.. One week to think about it.
1088.21 1092.01	        	... American democracy is dying.
1092.01 1097.78	        	... I want you to put that ... who=le .. phrase .. in black and white.
1097.78 1100.69	        	(H) American democracy is dying,
1100.69 1104.12	        	... and I want you to try to think .. of why.
1104.12 1107.75	        	.. As we get into the discussion .. of Chicano ... participation.
1107.75 1110.29	        	... And we'll get back to that statement .. next week.
1110.29 1112.16	        	... So,
1112.16 1113.12	        	... for us,
1113.12 1114.73	        	as Chicanos it's a double jeopardy.
1114.73 1116.73	        	... That's another point I wanna underscore.
1116.73 1121.48	        	... Because if the .. larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers,
1121.48 1124.98	        	(H) when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole,
1124.98 1126.44	        	and you're at the bottom,
1126.44 1128.82	        	... you're at the very bottom,
1128.82 1131.79	        	... with all the problems of poverty,
1131.79 1133.31	        	and all the social problems that we're --
1133.31 1134.69	        	(H) we've been talking about,
1134.69 1137.72	        	... it's understandable why,
1137.72 1138.39	        	... perhaps,
1138.39 1140.93	        	... Chicanos do not vote,
1140.93 1142.59	        	.. or participate in great numbers.
1142.59 1143.75	        	... (H) Now,
1143.75 1144.60	        	.. the literature,

1161.44 1163.25	        	... nineteen-seventy-two or so,
1163.25 1165.32	        	... is one book that you can look at,
1165.32 1166.64	        	... u=m,
1166.64 1169.89	        	... there's a book by .. Raymond Wolfinger,

1172.28 1173.34	        	(H) Who Votes,
1173.34 1174.43	        	... that's another book,
1174.43 1175.77	        	... <X Okay X>,
1175.77 1177.07	        	... the literature goes on and on.
1177.07 1178.47	        	... But all I want to do,
1178.47 1180.84	        	in terms of just giving you .. some idea.
1180.84 1183.33	        	... of what are the factors that influence,
1183.33 1186.20	        	peoples' participation in the political process of this country.
1186.20 1187.91	        	(H) And there are essentially five.
1187.91 1189.51	        	.. You can .. probably develop more,
1189.51 1189.75	        	but,
1189.75 1191.18	        	.. these are general categories.
1191.18 1194.57	        	... Most of the literature in political science,
1194.57 1196.75	        	... and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this,
1196.75 1197.47	        	(H) that,
1197.47 1201.60	        	... people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty.
1201.60 1202.38	        	... What does that mean.
1202.38 1203.56	        	.. A sense of duty.
1203.56 1207.31	        	... They regard participation as important.
1207.31 1209.99	        	... Now,
1209.99 1211.92	        	... why would you say,
1211.92 1214.78	        	.. that this .. is a factor that influences voting.
1214.78 1217.47	        	... Now this is a very somewhat altruistic,
1217.47 1218.58	        	... uh= value.
1218.58 1219.02	        	right?
1219.02 1220.73	        	... A sense of .. duty?
1220.73 1223.89	        	... Why.
1223.89 1226.12	        	... Why would you say,

1261.94 1263.68	MONTOYA: 	.. As we go through some of these,
1263.68 1264.59	        	... these five,
1264.59 1267.13	        	... I want you to think of %the agents of socialization.
1267.13 1268.37	        	... Because then I want you to think,
1268.37 1270.16	        	when we get into the discussion on Chicanos,
1270.16 1272.27	        	... how do those agents affect .. us as Chicanos.
1272.27 1272.66	        	Alright,
1272.66 1274.18	        	... number one,
1274.18 1275.04	        	sense of duty,
1275.04 1278.18	        	... Who is responsible for inculcating ... that sense of duty.
1278.18 1280.63	        	... One,
1280.63 1281.49	        	... the family.
1281.49 1282.36	        	... Alright?
1282.36 1282.83	        	.. Remember.
1282.83 1284.53	        	.. The family is your primary agent.
1284.53 1285.20	        	.. Two,
1285.20 1286.84	        	... the educational institutions.
1286.84 1288.69	        	... I mean,
1288.69 1290.40	        	from the time that you start .. kindergarten,
1290.40 1292.84	        	to the time that you .. graduate from the university,
1292.84 1293.80	        	(H) it's constant,
1293.80 1294.46	        	.. not constant,
1294.46 1297.70	        	.. but somewhat of a consistent .. bombardment .. of values,
1297.70 1298.57	        	.. attitudes,
1298.57 1299.34	        	et cetera,
1299.34 1301.83	        	... reinforcing the nature of the political system,

1306.11 1307.31	        	... (H) So in essence,
1307.31 1307.93	        	what I'm saying is,
1307.93 1310.23	        	you acquire this through the socialization process.
1310.23 1311.37	        	that we've discussed already.
1311.37 1311.94	        	... Yes?
1311.94 1316.54	RUBEN:  	... I think that it's more ... eye-opening,
1316.54 1317.40	        	.. to see,
1317.40 1318.61	        	.. that,
1318.61 1319.85	        	.. this doesn't exist,
1319.85 1320.93	        	... more than it does.
1320.93 1322.63	        	.. And that's why people don't vote.
1322.63 1323.67	        	(H) It seems that,
1323.67 1325.17	        	.. I mean you talk to people,
1325.17 1326.71	        	(H) they have an attitude,
1326.71 1328.26	        	.. I can't make a difference.
1328.26 1329.47	        	... That's why I don't vote.
1329.47 1332.19	        	.. It's not ... my .. responsibility.
1332.19 1333.42	        	That's why I don't vote.
1333.42 1334.82	        	... There's not a sense of duty.
1334.82 1335.68	        	.. Even though,
1335.68 1336.52	        	... like you said,
1336.52 1337.66	        	... from the beginning,
1337.66 1340.23	        	... supposedly we're getting it .. all through school.
1340.23 1341.83	MONTOYA: 	Why do you suppose that has changed.
1341.83 1343.13	        	... And this is a .. much,
1343.13 1344.31	        	... of a recent phenomena.
1344.31 1344.97	        	.. much more.
1344.97 1346.06	        	(H) Because you've had,
1346.06 1348.27	        	(H) .. declining voter participation levels=,
1348.27 1350.20	        	since= the nineteen-seventies.
1350.20 1351.55	        	.. And I'm giving you the answer.
1351.55 1354.02	        	... Wa- what what what has been the problem.
1354.02 1356.31	        	... Contributing to what you .. just said.

1359.88 1361.74	        	.. I think m- maybe one of the reasons could be,
1361.74 1362.87	        	.. they're not being represented,
1362.87 1364.18	        	they don't think they're being represented,

678.180	679.945		it was n=ot a clean broadcast system.
679.945	681.055		Like everything in the room,
681.055	682.860		if you had a Tesla coil in the middle of the room,
682.860	685.690		all the metal objects would be receiving it constant[ly].
685.185	685.690	JIM:	 [M]hm.
685.690	686.790	MICHAEL:	(H)= So,
686.790	688.730		.. it wasn't really a very efficient either.
688.730	689.780		.. Because you'd have to have a- --
689.780	692.225		(H) an immense amount of power being broadcast,
692.225	692.590		so that,
692.590	693.995		a few points could receive,
693.995	694.460		.. you know,
694.460	695.225		their share of it.
695.225	696.360		... (TSK) [(H)]
696.060	696.570	JIM:	 [now what] about,
696.570	697.095		if they --
697.095	698.225		0- with the superconductor.
698.225	699.310		Will that change all that?
699.310	701.330	MICHAEL:	... (TSK) I don't know.
701.330	704.615		.. He was dealing with it being ... basically energy,
704.615	705.765		and being sent through the air,
705.765	706.225		uh you know=,
706.225	706.995		like light,
706.995	707.510	JIM:	like,
707.510	707.960		.. yeah.
707.970	710.275		Like tapping right into just the energy of the earth,
710.275	710.945		or something.
710.945	711.445		[<X alright X>].
710.950	711.445	MICHAEL:	[yeah].
711.445	713.960		which doesn't really % .. [2require2] a conductor.
712.810	713.280	JIM:	[2yeah may-2] --
713.960	714.905	MICHAEL:	... you know,
714.905	716.540		I mean light will go through a vacuum.
716.540	718.415		... So,
718.415	719.445		.. % I think he was,
719.445	722.035		.. (H) I mean he va- basically invented the radio,
722.035	723.210		.. <% and stuff like that,
723.210	723.515		you know %>.
723.515	724.930		... (H)
724.930	727.515	JIM:	(H) It's pretty confusing to me (Hx).
727.515	728.090		but uh,
728.090	728.405		.. yeah,
728.405	731.245		those .. those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes,
731.245	731.550		uh,
731.550	731.780		or,
731.780	733.275		.. that are the unsung heroes.
733.275	733.515		(H)
733.515	733.890	MICHAEL:	yeah.
733.890	734.300	JIM:	You know,
734.300	734.660		.. the r- --
734.660	735.330		the= uh,
735.330	736.030		(H) and s- --
736.030	737.805		and and business and,
737.805	738.845		I mean this is a cliche,
738.845	739.050		but,
739.050	741.025		but business has always uh,
741.025	742.890		... taken these works,
742.890	743.205		and,
743.205	744.700		.. and manipulated em,
744.700	745.115		either,
745.115	746.570		... to their benefit,
746.570	746.895		or,

748.585	749.405		or to our detriment,

755.315	755.890	MICHAEL:	 [(TSK) Right].
755.890	756.255		.. it's like,

756.580	756.890		.. gee,
756.890	757.040		yeah,
757.040	757.330		 I know
757.330	758.855		I know how we can make money with this.
758.855	760.615		... I mean you just do it.
760.615	761.115	JIM:	yeah.
761.115	763.060		.. (H) <X Well X> that's what I like about fractals.
763.060	764.080		is because uh,

770.280	770.810		.. you know,
770.810	772.230		.. because it's mathematical,
772.230	772.505		and it --
772.505	775.710		.. I- .. it has to work I guess with= (H) numbers in it.
775.710	777.175		.. somew- some way.
777.175	778.415		(H) uh,
778.415	779.975		.. it's opens a door into,

783.560	784.955		(H) ... You know,
784.955	785.195	MICHAEL:	[hm].
784.955	785.295	JIM:	[with] --
785.295	787.395		if if regular math is the obvious,
787.395	788.340		(H) uh=,
788.340	789.765		.. these fractals seem to,

794.395	795.190	MICHAEL:	 [(TSK) Well,

796.335	797.445		I don't think it's everything.
797.445	798.285	JIM:	(TSK) not everything.
798.285	798.750		[but s- --
798.285	798.955	MICHAEL:	[cause there are t-],

799.765	800.390		into that.
800.390	800.920	MICHAEL:	.. yeah.
800.920	801.770		... (H) well,
801.770	802.040		it --
802.040	802.205		like --
802.205	803.185		every theory is just like-,
803.185	804.255		% .. %_it's a window,
804.255	806.670		and it's also like a model of um .. reality,
806.670	807.810		and it's really not reality.
807.810	809.445		(H) And uh,
809.445	812.115		... like a fractal can g=et really close at do- % --

819.760	820.535		by any stretch.
820.535	822.410		But for mathematics or for science,
822.410	822.930		it's the- --
822.935	824.690		[it's an opportunity for them to --

828.040	828.430		or the,

829.975	830.200		Uh,

843.440	844.185		we don't bother,
844.185	845.590		to ask the American people,

862.000	862.860		(H) and it [has] --
862.485	862.860	MICHAEL:	[Aah].
862.860	863.135	JIM:	and it,
863.135	864.995		and it's manifesting itself in,

875.785	878.055	MICHAEL:	 [so you're saying it] might have done the sa=me ba=d thing,

890.900	893.655		(H) this phantasmagorical experience goes,
893.655	894.800		(H) and that when they did that,
894.800	896.895		it's possible that they started a chain reaction,

906.635	907.050	MICHAEL:	 [Yeah].
907.770	908.445	JIM:	it might take,

913.515	914.360	JIM:	[or] a hundred years.

919.140	919.715		to me=,

938.395	939.635		The decision was made easier.

939.775	940.180	MICHAEL:	[oh].
941.755	943.720	JIM:	(H) there might have been a little more caution,

949.735	950.725		no they don't imply morals,
950.725	953.270		but they do imply that there's more than the obvious going on.
953.270	954.700	MICHAEL:	.. Well all math does that.

965.990	967.960	MICHAEL:	Ein]stein's theory is a model in the fourth dimension,

968.815	970.540		... (H) ... Um,

974.615	975.660		any number of dimensions.
975.660	976.470		it's basically,

386.783	387.305		you remember,
387.305	388.903		when some deserted him,
388.903	389.979		and .. seemed,
389.979	392.806		because they were disappointed in .. some of his sayings,
392.806	396.124		(H) and they were offended by some of the things he said,
395.817	398.951		(H) ... and they walked no longer with him it said.
398.951	401.441		... (TSK) And then he turned to those who remained,
401.441	402.117		and he said,
402.117	404.821		<Q Will ye also go away Q>?
404.821	406.081		... They had a choice.
406.081	406.941		Didn't they?
406.941	409.246		
406.941	409.246		... Will you go away.
409.246	411.458		.. What do you will.
411.458	412.411		(H) .. And the will,
412.411	413.578		.. apparently was,
413.578	416.405		re- resided in .. in these disciples.
416.405	418.372		(H) And so Erasmus is going to say,
418.372	419.202		so obviously,
419.202	421.906		in Scripture we ha=ve .. paradox.
421.906	424.979		... We have clea=r passages of Scripture,
424.979	428.974		(H) which seem to indicate that ma=n .. <<POUND +has a +free will,
428.974	430.848		.. and that he can +exercise POUND>> that will,
430.848	431.493		.. to follow,
431.493	432.692		or not to follow.
432.692	434.689		(H) To respond or not to respond.
434.689	435.611		(H) On the other hand,
435.611	437.639		(H) we have passages of Scripture,
437.639	439.636		(H) which .. seem to indicate,
439.636	441.787		... that the will is not free,
441.787	442.771		... and that the-,
442.771	443.908		and that man i- th- is- --
443.908	448.916		man is predestined .. by a .. an omnipotent sovereign will of God.
448.916	452.143		(H) ... We have to take both these pass- --
452.143	454.724		So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority.
454.724	456.621		..  We both accept the scriptural authority.
456.570	457.856		And Erasmus in his writings,
457.856	459.818		and in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio,
457.856	459.818		in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio,
459.818	460.681		says to Luther,
460.681	462.524		qu- because it is addressed to Luther you see,
462.524	464.064		(H) he says to Luther,
464.064	464.723		(H) uh,
464.723	466.026		I will not church --
466.026	467.362		.. I will not .. question,
467.362	467.785		or I not --
467.785	468.597		I will not quote.
468.597	471.388		I will not quote the Church Fathers to you,
471.388	475.431		(H) because I understand you accept <@ no Church Father authority,
475.431	477.748		(H) if it is in disagreement with your opinion @>.  
477.748	481.368		(H) So I will quote the only authority that you recognize,
481.469	482.620		.. The Holy Scriptures.
482.620	483.719		... (TSK) And so,
483.719	484.091		.. uh,
484.091	487.051		exclusively Erasmus will appeal to the Scriptures,
487.051	488.269		as his basis.
488.269	490.908		(H) When God created Adam and Eve in the garden,
490.908	492.058		he placed them in the garden,
492.058	493.513		and he said you have a choice.
493.581	494.968		(H)= Uh=,
494.968	495.830		you have a choice.
495.830	498.300		Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good- --
498.300	499.738		of the tree of good and evil,
499.738	500.803		for on the day ye eat thereof,
500.803	502.190		ye shall surely die.
502.190	502.765		.. Now=,
502.765	503.645		do not do that,
503.645	506.419		.. and obviously Go=d m=ust have given,
506.419	509.109		the first (H) created pair,
509.109	510.090		(H) a choice.
510.090	515.316		Because the whole (H) system .. of reward or punishment,
515.316	518.598		.. is based upon the decision which is .. these individuals made.
518.598	519.055		Or=,
519.055	521.423		(H) when Cai=n slew Abel.
521.423	523.063		(H)= (TSK) U=m,
523.063	524.603		.. if you do we=ll?
524.603	526.768		.. Shall you not be s- sustained?
526.768	528.020		But if you do evil?
528.020	530.675		(H) Sin .. crouches at the door.
530.675	532.722		... If you do well.
532.722	533.872		... Apparently,
533.872	534.616		from this,
534.616	537.001		... Cain .. had the ability,
537.001	538.270		.. even after the mur- --
538.270	540.266		 0.000000e+00ven after the murder of Abel,
540.266	542.330		(H) he had the ab=ility,
542.330	544.850		(H) to make a positive choice.
544.850	546.423		.. According to Erasmus.
546.423	547.996		That's going to be his position.
547.996	549.265		(H) Well Luther,
549.265	549.941		.. (TSK) um,
549.941	553.257		.. I'll g- I'll I'll tell- say some of the things that he he picked first,
553.257	554.373		Erasmus picked first,
554.373	555.523		(H) and um,
555.523	556.995		.. he's gonna go all through the Scriptures,
556.995	558.822		and he's gonna take passages like this,
558.822	559.786		(H) um,
559.786	562.645		... (TSK) return return the prophets said,
562.645	564.116		did they not to ancient Israel.
564.116	565.723		Return to the God of the covenant,
565.723	568.413		return (H) Hosea pleads with Gomer,
568.413	570.239		.. please come back .. t_you see.
570.239	571.102		(H) And uh,
571.102	572.658		this is the symbol of Israel,
572.658	574.096		come back to the Lord,
574.096	576.904		(H) come back to the= the husband of the covenant,
576.904	580.033		come back to= the one who called you and summoned you,
580.033	580.964		(H) it's the- --
580.964	582.977		Erasmus says the whole premise is,
582.977	585.565		(H) that you have a- an ability,
585.565	586.343		to return.
586.343	588.778		That you can make up your mi=nd,
588.778	591.603		(H) to change the course that you're now taking.
591.603	593.650		(H) And that you can .. go this way,
593.650	595.071		.. or you can go that way.
595.065	596.335		(H) And uh,
596.335	598.296		.. then there are other arguments which are,
598.296	599.510		(H) uh,
599.510	600.108		.. here's uh,
600.108	601.442		here's one on um,
601.442	602.696		I'll read an excerpt,
602.696	603.850		... in this uh,
603.850	604.647		in this little book,
604.647	605.742		this is the um,
605.742	607.334		
605.742	607.334		.. the actual uh,
608.808	612.192		... wr- writings of the s- f- .. freedom of the will,
612.192	615.377		(H) .. here's he .. he uses Ecclesiastes.
615.377	616.412		... God,
616.412	617.408		and this is a quote,
617.408	618.164		(H) from the b- --
618.164	618.742		.. from the book.
618.742	621.569		(H) <READ God made man from the beginning,
621.569	624.654		.. (H) and left him in the hand of his own counsel.
624.654	627.203		... (TSK) He added his commandments,
627.203	629.054		... (H) and .. precepts.
629.054	631.463		...  If thou would keep the commandments,
631.463	635.644		.. and perform acceptable .. fidelity forever,
635.305	638.033		(H) .. they shall .. preserve thee.
638.212	639.486		... He hath set w- --
639.486	642.233		he hath set water and fire before thee.
642.233	644.224		... Stretch forth thy hand,
644.224	646.036		(H) to which thou wilt.
646.036	649.380		(H) ... Before man is life and death.
649.380	650.873		... Good and evil.
650.873	652.884		... That which he shall choose,
652.884	654.397		(H) shall be given him READ>.
654.397	657.005		... Choose.
657.005	659.454		... (H) So Erasmus's argument is,
659.454	660.887		.. you have a right to choose.
660.887	661.882		You can choose.
661.882	664.391		(H) And therefore if you can choose,
664.391	668.074		this presupposes ... (TSK) that you have a free will.
668.074	669.308		(H) In any rate,
669.308	671.259		... if .. man is,
671.259	671.970		... uh,
671.970	674.305		if there is a necessity in man's action.
674.305	676.614		If he is pre=determined to sin.
676.614	680.317		(H) .. If .. if God has already determined,
680.317	683.483		(H) that this person .. commits these acts.
683.483	687.823		(H) Then .. there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor.
687.823	689.594		(H) On the part of the perpetrator.
689.594	693.297		Because how can a person be held responsible (H) for deeds,
693.297	695.169		(H) which he does,
695.169	697.578		.. if he= 0mself did not will those,
697.578	697.996		the- f- --
697.996	698.175		if,
698.175	698.792		in other words,
698.812	700.046		he may will those deeds,
700.046	700.604		but those --
700.604	705.282		th- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force.
705.282	707.153		(H)= If that is the case,
707.153	709.045		then there is really no freedom of the will.
709.204	710.677		(H) And if uh=,
710.677	711.493		in that case,
711.493	712.031		therefore,
712.031	714.917		a person cannot be responsible for his deeds,
714.917	717.068		(H) if the deeds which he commits,
717.068	719.437		have already been eternally foreordained.
719.437	721.527		.. (SNIFF) This is uh=,
721.527	723.896		this is going to be then Erasmus's argument,
723.896	726.225		ag- on this qu- on this question of the freedom of the will.
726.225	727.559		(H) But uh=,
727.559	728.674		.. uh,
728.674	732.456		(H) .. we'll .. look at another couple p- uh of his passages.
732.456	732.875		If,
732.875	733.432		.. here it is.
733.432	735.761		<READ If the will  .. were not free,
735.761	739.325		... (H) sin could not be attributed to man.
739.325	742.191		... (TSK) It ceases to be sin.
742.191	744.142		... If it is not voluntary.
744.142	747.228		.. (H) Free wi=ll is not extinct.
747.228	751.170		... Though it has contracted a paralysis READ>.
751.170	756.235		... (SNIFF) ... (H) How is it paralyzed.
756.235	757.859		Well it's paralyzed by the fall.
757.859	760.825		... See we all= .. participate in the Adamic nature.
760.825	763.533		... (TSK) (H) A=nd this Adamic nature,
763.533	763.991		.. uh,
763.991	764.628		when Adam=,
764.628	765.305		.. in Adam=,
765.305	766.619		remember the New Eng- .. New England primer,
766.619	767.992		<Q in Adam's fall,
767.992	769.087		we sinned all Q>.
769.087	770.481		(SNIFF)= So=,
770.481	772.312		this Adamic nature has been,
772.312	775.657		.. has been passed on to all generation=s of humans.
775.657	777.747		(H) And so therefore while we --
777.747	779.599		(H) we have a free will,
779.678	780.037		it is --
780.037	781.191		it is paralyzed.
781.191	783.899		.. It's not the will .. that was there.
783.899	785.651		.. (H) It's not the will,
785.651	787.004		... that uh,
787.004	788.717		... that Adam had.
788.717	792.957		... Because .. it no longer .. has the freedom .. that Adam had.
792.957	794.390		It is cursed by sin.
794.390	795.844		It is under the curse of sin.
795.844	797.138		(H) So the human will,
797.138	797.954		somehow,
797.954	799.049		is paralyzed.
799.049	801.438		(H) ... Uh Erasmus admits that.
801.438	802.354		(H) And then,
802.354	803.548		Erasmus will say,
803.548	804.484		that um,
804.484	807.629		... (TSK) (H) God then enables.
807.629	808.505		What God does,
808.505	810.974		and this will be the C- really the modern Catholic view.
810.974	814.916		(H) That God will provide a prevenient grace.
814.916	816.787		... A prevenient grace.
816.807	817.543		That is in other words,
817.543	821.007		even though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation,
821.007	821.605		you see,
821.605	822.978		(H) that um,
822.978	826.482		... that God will give me a prevenient grace,
826.482	829.070		(H) which will .. enable me,
829.070	831.818		 .. to move toward .. this salvation.
831.818	835.520		... (TSK) (H) And if I then respo=nd.
835.520	837.153		.. positively.
837.153	838.885		(H) .. To the gift of God,
838.885	843.424		(H) then .. God will extend .. the exemplary grace to me,
843.424	846.609		.. which enables me ... to acquire salvation.
846.609	848.421		(H) So prevenient grace,
848.421	849.874		will put you on the path.
849.914	852.801		(H) ... If you respond on the path,
852.801	855.986		(H) then God extends the exemplary grace,
855.986	857.698		(H) which will lead you home.
857.698	860.067		(H) He uses a little= story.

941.949	943.024		(H) It doesn't,
943.024	943.462		.. as I said,
943.462	944.895		
943.462	944.895		it doesn't carry him there,
944.895	947.782		(H) it doesn't .. go get the apple and bring it to him,
947.782	949.813		(H) he must go to the apple.
949.813	953.456		But he goes= sustained by this prevenient grace.
953.456	954.013		And then,
954.013	954.710		(H) if he,
954.710	956.940		(H) .. if he half way to the apple,
956.940	958.333		if he decides he doesn't want it,
958.333	962.593		... if he .. if he sees something he th- considers more attractive,
962.593	964.186		.. and he goes off on a tangent,
964.186	965.520		or goes off in a different direction,
965.520	966.515		(H) then you see,
966.515	970.278		.. then his wi=ll has decided that he does not want to cooperate.
970.278	972.209		... With prevenient grace.
972.209	974.996		(H)= Luther hated that word cooperation.
974.996	976.967		W- particularly in connection with grace.
976.967	978.958		.. (H) Now Luther's position is,
978.958	982.283		.. we are dead ... in trespasses and sin.
982.283	983.338		(H) You see.
983.457	986.762		.. There is (H) nothing (H) that can .. come to us,
986.762	989.430		you see now Luther came to his reformation remember,
989.430	992.197		(H) with this fear of the righteousness of God.
992.197	994.387		(H)= The righteousness of God.
994.387	996.557		And Luther all through his monastic life,
996.557	998.448		up until around fifteen fifteen,
998.448	1000.618		is probably when he made that tower discovery.

1071.570	1073.879		... (TSK) That the righteousness of God,
1073.879	1075.791		... is passive righteousness.
1075.791	1077.330		.. It's not the righteousness,
1077.330	1077.610		you see,
1077.610	1078.100		Luther said,
1078.100	1081.086		<Q I hated that .. that phrase righteousness of God.
1081.086	1083.216		(H) What does righteousness of God mean.
1083.216	1084.849		(H) Righteousness of God means,
1084.909	1086.163		(H) God is holy.

1193.205	1193.728		(H) So,
1193.740	1194.607		(H) Luther,
1194.607	1195.716		from his point of view,
1195.716	1196.086		you see,

1219.785	1220.766		(H) N=o.
1220.766	1222.984		... There is nothing you can do to please God.
1222.984	1224.693		(H) .. God .. loves you,
1224.693	1225.878		.. he gives you his grace,

1239.162	1240.526		It's interesting in um,

1245.128	1246.262		(H) But it's still,
1246.262	1247.843		it comes in an interesting scene.

1250.240	1251.527		It's in the second world war,

1478.103	1480.336		every time the city launches a project,
1480.336	1481.353		(H) because you say,

654.860	656.470		(H) as it is doing this flask here,
656.470	657.310		(H) is because,

849.980	850.840		the air insi=de,
850.840	852.800		is getting colder and colder and colder.
852.800	854.810		(H) Okay those molecules are slowing down.
854.810	855.850		They're going slower and slower,
855.850	858.030		(H) and so they're getting closer and closer together.
858.030	858.430		Okay?

864.140	865.130		(H) they're going slower,
865.130	866.100		so they're closer together,
866.100	867.390		and they take up less space,
867.390	869.260		(H) in this (H) balloon.
870.530	872.510		... And look .. at the balloon.
872.510	873.780		(H) At the very bottom of it.

879.200	882.520		(H) .. The molecules have gotten so= .. slowed down,
882.520	883.690		and so close together that,

897.120	898.580		they're getting further and further apart,
898.580	900.760		(H) .. and taking up more space inside the balloon,
900.760	903.260		so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape.
903.260	905.960		(H) So that has to be what's happening (H) to the balloons,
905.960	907.690		that are inside this container here.
907.810	909.000		(H) Alright?

910.250	912.260		these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen,

915.870	917.020		(Hx) (H) the air,
917.020	918.470		... took up less space inside the balloons.

442.850	445.070		... And then the return is .. back here.
448.350	448.850	SETH:	... Okay.
448.850	450.140		.. Good sized return.
450.140	450.480	LARRY:	.. Yeah.
450.480	452.730	SETH:	Now you're not looking at % .. adding air conditioning.
452.730	453.200		.. Right?
453.200	453.840	LARRY:	Well,
454.140	456.350		... [we would] like to have that as an option.
454.340	454.770	SETH:	    [X]
456.310	456.790		.. [2Okay].
456.350	457.510	LARRY:	   [2We could2] always add that later.
457.510	457.940		Right?
458.150	458.530	SETH:	... Yeah.
458.530	459.690		One of the things you can do,
459.690	461.690		if .. if you don't wanna do it now,
461.690	462.480		... you can,
462.480	463.020		.. what they call,
463.020	464.110		.. prep for air conditioning.
464.110	465.790		You can put in the coil.
465.790	467.820		... See you've [got the] furnace and the coil,
466.190	466.600	LARRY:	               [<X Yeah X>].
467.820	468.660	SETH:	(H) and then,
468.660	470.600		... when you add air conditioning in the future,
470.600	473.090		... all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit,
473.090	475.330		... and refrigerant piping to that coil.
476.360	477.420		... So it .. saves --
477.420	479.860		.. it saves= additional work in the future.
480.310	480.730	LARRY:	... Mhm.
480.650	482.440	SETH:	Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in,
482.440	484.400		which means you gotta modify the duct work,
484.400	485.910		to [get that] coil in there so,
484.460	484.880	LARRY:	   [Right].
485.940	487.640	SETH:	.. (H) if you're thinking about doing it in the future,
487.640	488.960		you might wanna at least put the coil in.
488.960	491.840		It only .. costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil.
491.840	492.460	LARRY:	Oh.
492.460	492.860		.. Alright.
492.860	494.860	SETH:	.. It's the it's the out[door air conditioning <X that X>] --
493.690	493.920	LARRY:	                        [Well,
493.920	495.120		.. write that in] there,

499.030	499.380	LARRY:	Yeah.
499.380	499.610		If you --
499.610	501.740		if you go over and have a look at the dining room,

503.300	503.780	LARRY:	yeah,
503.780	508.280		.. and % we're gonna be making changes to the ... to the house too,

561.400	563.100	SETH:	.. tie those together like that.
563.100	563.920	LARRY:	.. See this this --
563.920	565.940		The end of this room might be modified.

647.890	648.160	LARRY:	       [that --

652.570	652.900	SETH:	... Aw,
652.900	653.430		so you'll need --
653.430	654.580		.. What about .. heating for that.
654.580	655.070	LARRY:	.. Well,
655.070	657.650		.. what we're gonna do is put uh .. radiated heat.

659.010	660.250	SETH:	.. [That'll be a slab] floor then.
659.020	659.730	LARRY:	   [For sure].
659.960	660.230		Yeah,

660.970	661.800		.. (H) [Uh],

674.650	675.140	LARRY:	... Yeah.
675.150	675.460		.. [Probably].
675.140	677.810	SETH:	   [Cause it] would be nice to have heat in here (H) in the meantime.
678.430	679.830		... I mean say you do the furnace,
680.030	681.860		... It would be nice to have it .. for this winter.

683.530	684.480		... Put that as a --
684.480	685.500	SETH:	.. But one thing you can do,
685.500	687.140		even if you do a modification,
687.140	688.310		you can move the register.
688.830	692.730		... I mean say we put the register right ... h=ere,
692.730	693.600		.. and that's gonna b- --
693.610	695.200		%= that would obviously have to be moved,
695.490	695.990		... you know,
695.990	697.810		it's not a [big deal] to move it from here to here.
696.300	696.720	LARRY:	           [Yeah].
697.810	699.350	SETH:	You might have to add a piece of duct work,
699.350	701.360		(H) but it's not gonna be a major change,
701.350	701.970	LARRY:	Okay.
702.080	702.650		... Okay.
703.720	705.240	SETH:	... And this one you may not have to move at all.
705.240	706.330		That may be okay.
707.580	708.040	LARRY:	... Alright.
708.570	709.920	SETH:	... But then that's probably how I'd do it,
709.920	710.820		some- .. something like that,
710.820	711.250		or,
711.250	712.990		if I had the registers .. going that way,
713.810	715.400		... that might be the best way to do it.
715.420	718.000		... It'd be like for- fourteen by six,
718.940	720.450	LARRY:	... (SNIFF) (SNIFF) (SNIFF)

722.340	723.310		that'd be a ten-inch,
724.840	725.620		... and then the furnace,
725.620	725.950		I don't know,

773.880	775.720		(H) The return grill's plenty big enough.
775.720	776.040	LARRY:	.. yeah.
776.040	777.160		It's a big [return,
776.330	777.160	SETH:	           [I mean I can't --
777.160	778.910		you can't] have any kind of problem [2there2],
777.160	777.770	LARRY:	and a] --
778.300	779.900		[2and2] and the pipes are big enough,
779.900	780.310		so=,
780.310	781.740		and that's normally when you get --
781.740	784.220		.. you get .. a lot of noise .. in the house.
784.420	786.150		(H) Is if your= --
786.370	788.990		... if your uh ... ducts are too small.
788.990	789.330		Right?
789.330	789.790	SETH:	Right.
790.520	790.750		.. (H) Yeah,
790.760	792.450		y- the two main sources of noise,
792.450	793.230		.. are either,
794.690	795.300		... uh=,
795.720	796.550		... air noise,
796.550	798.520		.. which is due to undersized grills,
798.420	798.880	LARRY:	Really?
798.880	800.990	SETH:	you got air rushing through there at high velocity.
801.040	804.250		(H) The other source of noise is th- .. is the fan motor itself.
804.250	804.450		(H)
804.410	805.780	LARRY:	In the- in the actual --
805.780	807.190	SETH:	.. In the .. unit itself.
806.940	807.350	LARRY:	Unhunh.
807.190	808.490	SETH:	And that's usually solved by b-,
809.010	812.710		just having flexible duct between the unit .. and the d- and the registers,
812.710	814.370		so that it dampens out the noise.
814.650	817.480		(H) In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall=,
817.480	818.740		(H) it would be noisy.
818.610	819.130	LARRY:	.. Yeah.
819.130	819.740	SETH:	But we're going d- --
819.740	821.280		I'm not sure how it .. connects,
821.540	822.820		... did we see that down there?
823.050	824.990		... I'll have to go down and take a look at that again [but,
824.390	824.980	LARRY:	                                                       [Okay].
825.040	826.670	SETH:	(H)] I imagine it goes dow=n,
826.820	829.000		.. (H) and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit.
829.000	832.010		As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit,
832.350	833.130		.. (H) [then I] --
832.620	833.130	LARRY:	       [You can].
833.130	836.170	SETH:	.. then I can= uh ... eliminate th- .. the noise problem.
836.170	836.840	LARRY:	.. Alright.

857.990	858.420		Right?
858.880	859.810	LARRY:	... this is the supply.
859.810	860.190		Right.
860.040	860.690	SETH:	Okay.

867.950	868.530		.. I would say g-,
868.530	869.730		I'd probably go with two.
870.460	871.550		... I'd put one on each side,
871.560	873.930		I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there,
874.660	876.300		... and maybe underneath that window.
876.930	878.510		... Be nice to put it behind the couch,
878.510	878.960		but then you've --
878.970	880.450		it would be blocked off too much.

881.090	883.730		you so you .. you p- you try and put em= under windows,

884.990	885.260	SETH:	                      [(Hx)] .. Yeah.

885.660	885.860	LARRY:	         [X] --
886.740	888.190	SETH:	basically the coldest part of the room (Hx).
888.180	888.840	LARRY:	Okay.
889.140	890.840	SETH:	... (TSK) Because uh,

898.870	899.270	LARRY:	Mhm.
899.270	900.130	SETH:	Cause what happens is,
900.130	902.390		the air goes b=ack to the return grill,
902.590	903.650		(H) [so it never really,

926.400	927.820		 I would go with floor registers in this house,

934.560	935.310	LARRY:	Right.

1021.845	1023.490		(H) He tries to help,
1023.490	1026.085		... or tries to intervene between two other,
1027.110	1027.640		... uh,
1029.340	1030.215		... Hebrew,
1030.215	1032.185		... that were arguing amongst themself and,
1032.185	1032.720		.. and,
1032.720	1034.935		... he tries to be a peacemaker,
1034.935	1035.515		and they say,
1035.515	1036.205		(H) you know,
1036.205	1037.340		who made you judge,
1037.495	1038.635		... w- what about this,
1038.635	1040.195		you just killed the guy the other day,
1040.195	1041.145		(H) Uh=,
1041.145	1042.605		and he realized that people knew.
1042.605	1043.840		... And he realized if these- --
1043.840	1044.890		.. if these men knew,
1044.890	1047.500		(H) then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon,
1047.500	1048.290		and so he left.
1048.290	1049.040		He fled.
1049.040	1050.260		.. (H) He ran.
1051.270	1052.835		... He went out into the wilderness.
1062.670	1064.740		... After a few days of .. uh walking,
1064.740	1066.525		he ... comes upon a a scene,
1066.525	1069.930		where these two young ladies are herding ... their father's sheep,
1069.930	1071.210		(H) and uh,
1071.210	1071.780		some,
1072.515	1073.090		... uh,
1073.090	1074.145		.. mean guys,
1074.145	1075.525		(H) who knows,
1075.525	1076.775		I don't .. remember who it was,
1076.775	1077.150		but anyway,
1077.150	1078.425		they came up and tried to,
1078.425	1079.395		.. to= uh,
1079.395	1081.475		... take advantage of the .. two ladies,
1081.475	1082.670		trying to take care of the sheep,
1082.670	1083.905		(H) and uh,
1084.865	1087.320		% ... and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep,
1087.320	1088.360		or trying to steal the women,
1088.360	1089.005		.. either way,
1089.510	1089.960		... uh,
1089.960	1090.395		but,
1090.395	1091.630		.. Moses intervened,
1091.630	1092.585		and he ran them off.
1092.585	1094.100		... And saved their lives.
1094.100	1095.920		and saved .. their .. livestock.
1095.920	1098.655		(H) And so they invited him to come with them,
1098.655	1099.675		to .. to their home,
1099.675	1101.295		and they told their father what had happened,
1101.295	1103.000		and he invited Moses to stay with them,
1103.000	1104.900		(H) Moses ends up marrying.
1105.270	1105.850		... uh,
1105.850	1107.300		.. one of the young ladies.
1107.300	1109.645		.. As #Ken ... shared with us the other day,
1109.645	1111.006		it was a .. a mixed marriage,
1111.006	1111.695		because these,
1111.695	1112.150		.. uh,
1112.150	1113.685		.. this family was Black.
1113.685	1123.755		.. (H) ... So for the next .. forty years.
1123.755	1125.375		... he becomes a sheep herder,
1125.375	1126.655		for his father-in-law.
1126.655	1128.745		... Who was a .. a Midian priest.
1131.815	1133.250		... And during that forty years,
1133.250	1135.345		he he g- gained some other training.
1135.345	1136.905		.. First of all he became an outdoorsman.
1136.905	1139.420		He became used to being out .. in the wilderness.
1139.420	1141.000		... And that's gonna be important for him,
1141.000	1142.915		for his ... final forty years.
1142.915	1145.165		(H) ... Another thing he's,
1145.165	1145.545		is,
1145.545	1147.705		.. the area where he herded the sheep,
1147.705	1150.515		was a .. a huge ... area.
1150.695	1152.700		... And uh he got to know the terrain,
1152.700	1153.915		He got to know his way around.
1153.915	1157.445		.. And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years,
1157.445	1158.675		(H) in that same area.
1158.675	1160.065		and it was important that he knew where there-,
1160.065	1162.160		(H) the w- .. waterholes were and,
1162.160	1164.310		and where the dangerous .. areas were.
1164.310	1165.505		.. (H) ... Uh,
1165.505	1167.390		... and so God .. prepared him.
1170.885	1173.655		... (H) God also= has .. prepared us,
1173.655	1174.835		and is preparing us,
1174.835	1175.455		... for h- --
1175.455	1176.420		for our part,
1176.420	1177.685		... in God's mission.
1180.335	1182.585		... God is continually .. building character.
1182.585	1183.205		And I think,
1184.340	1187.100		... this .. middle forty years for Moses,
1187.100	1187.560		was a=,
1187.560	1189.775		was a time where God really built character.
1189.775	1191.885		Cause he no longer had everything he wanted,
1191.885	1192.400		... uh,
1192.400	1193.740		at his fingertips,
1193.740	1194.510		(H) uh,
1194.510	1195.705		he had to learn some things.
1195.705	1196.330		He had to learn.
1196.330	1198.990		.. He had to (H) learn how to depend on God.
1198.990	1201.090		... ON this God that he had learned about.
1201.500	1202.520		... From his mother.
1207.975	1210.660		... And God is interested in building character in us.
1210.660	1211.925		.. as individuals.
1213.625	1214.110		... In fact,
1214.110	1216.855		God is more concerned about .. our character,
1216.855	1217.770		than what we do.
1218.880	1219.980		... And how we do it.
1221.585	1223.195		... And so a lot of what we experience,
1223.195	1224.380		we get frustrated with,
1224.380	1229.215		.. but God's ... purpose .. is to build character within us.
1229.935	1233.695		... And so when we're trying to decide w- which we should do or not do,
1233.695	1235.445		.. something that we're tempted to do,
1235.445	1236.810		(H) we need to remember that,
1236.810	1238.440		God's more concerned about our character,
1238.440	1240.437		(H) and we should .. be obedient to Him,
1240.437	1242.640		because that's how He builds .. our character.
1248.315	1250.220		... I believe that God has created,
1250.220	1251.190		.. and preserved,
1251.190	1253.275		.. and prepared Uptown Baptist Church.
1253.730	1255.460		... To be involved in His mission.
1258.225	1261.170		... To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting.
1263.830	1265.385		... To be an influence.
1266.400	1268.105		... to the community of Uptown,
1270.015	1271.370		... for the Kingdom of God.
1273.640	1275.437		... To be a beacon of light,
1275.437	1276.935		... for those who are lost,
1280.135	1282.363		... and as our sign says on top,
1282.363	1286.450		.. to proclaim that ... Christ died for our sins.
1289.670	1292.615		... God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church,
1297.975	1302.400		... to be a model for urban .. church .. missions to the world.
1307.540	1309.393		... And that wasn't .. our reasoning,
1309.393	1311.155		we didn't set out to do the things we do,
1311.155	1312.585		so that we could be a model,
1312.585	1316.220		(H) .. or so that we could ... get ... publicity,
1316.220	1321.145		(H) ... But God has saw- seen fit to use us in that way.
1321.145	1323.490		(H) And this is not for our pride,
1325.590	1328.345		... this is just ... a reality.
1328.525	1331.805		... I'm amazed at how ... people from all over the world,
1331.805	1333.130		have have come,
1333.130	1334.100		(H) to the city,
1334.100	1335.737		and they've come to Uptown Baptist Church,
1335.737	1337.400		because they heard about us somewhere else,
1337.400	1338.420		in another country.
1338.670	1339.825		... or they read a book,
1339.825	1342.365		.. uh that talked about Uptown Baptist Church.
1350.330	1351.365		... God has crea- --
1351.365	1354.595		also= .. created an prepared you and me,
1355.250	1356.845		... to be involved in His plan.
1358.610	1361.935		... First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him.
1362.630	1364.805		... Some of us have accepted that call,
1364.805	1366.580		... and some .. are still struggling with it.
1367.565	1368.550		... But still,
1368.550	1371.455		... He wants to have a love .. relationship,
1371.805	1373.925		.. with each person that is in this room.
1382.090	1384.661		... He's brought us together from many backgrounds,
1384.661	1386.501		.. many very different backgrounds.
1386.501	1387.785		.. to be a family.
1387.785	1390.967		.. (H) A family of followers ... of Christ.
1393.660	1396.515		... A family to be involved .. in God's mission.
1398.095	1399.765		... Building the Kingdom of God.
1404.265	1405.944		... I was talking to #Greg on Friday.
1405.944	1406.610		#Greg #Gey, 
1408.145	1409.199		... and he was sharing wi- --
1409.199	1410.786		somehow we got in a conversation,
1410.786	1412.257		and he was saying something about,
1412.257	1415.961		he ... he really needed (Hx) .. intellectual stimulation,
1415.961	1418.200		because he tended to be more intellectual,
1418.200	1420.702		(H) .. and we were talking about why,
1420.702	1422.600		some people were intellectual and some weren't.
1423.570	1426.585		... And God just ... flashed in my mind.
1426.585	1427.604		And I said #Greg.
1427.604	1428.780		.. You know God,
1429.260	1430.837		... created you to be intellectual,
1430.837	1433.300		so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals.
1433.300	1435.420		So that you could share %with them on their level.
1435.420	1438.320		(H) Because Go=d didn't create us for our purpose,
1438.320	1440.770		.. God created .. us for His purpose.
1440.770	1442.565		(H) And that's something we have to keep,
1442.565	1443.395		(H) ... in --
1443.395	1444.270		.. before us.
1444.270	1445.569		.. God has created us,
1445.569	1446.645		m=ade us like we are.
1446.645	1449.490		Allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced.
1449.490	1451.745		(H) ... For his purpose.
1452.585	1454.645		... And it's for us to= seek Him,
1454.645	1456.550		and to know what His purpose is.
1459.320	1460.900		... #Papa #Joe has been a,
1460.900	1463.435		.. a very strong influence in this community.
1463.740	1466.150		... (H) Not because of his education,
1467.855	1470.124		... his educations came from the streets.
1476.760	1480.390		... And as he came to ... a relationship with Jesus Christ,
1480.390	1481.685		he came from a background,
1481.685	1483.333		.. that w- had survi=ved,
1483.333	1484.345		from the streets.
1484.340	1487.340		... (TSK) (H) ... He was an alcoholic.
1488.580	1489.375		... Now w- how- --
1489.375	1491.180		why= has God use him.
1491.180	1492.630		... He wasn't educated,
1493.035	1494.965		... he didn't go through special training,
1495.965	1497.260		... it's because,
1497.545	1499.480		... God prepared him,
1499.480	1501.815		... with the experience of his life,
1501.815	1506.690		(H) so that he could reach out to other people who are .. going through the same experience.
1507.125	1509.660		... So you can't say well I don't have an education.
1509.660	1510.207		Or I don't --

137.059	139.037		(H) and then lined with three feet of concrete.
139.037	141.740		.. (H) You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels.
141.740	143.063		... (H) They then came up here,
143.063	145.367		and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high,
145.367	148.081		(H) to force this river into these diversion tunnels.
148.081	149.225		(H) Came back down here,
149.225	150.932		built the other part of that cofferda=m,
150.932	152.823		(H) about sixty-five feet high=,
152.823	155.578		(H) to keep this water from backing into the work area.
155.578	157.284		(H) They now had from he=re,
157.284	159.045		(H) to here where they could build a dam.
159.045	161.085		.. (H) They pumped the water out of this area,
161.085	164.614		(H) and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock.
164.614	165.550		.. (H) Okay folks,
165.550	166.210		if you will please,
166.210	168.142		take a look at this picture taken during construction,
168.142	170.764		.. (H) looks like a series of boxes or blocks,
170.764	172.160		stacked one on top of the other,
172.160	174.694		.. (H) and those are wooden concrete fo=rms.
174.694	177.381		(H) Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high,
177.381	179.659		(H) but they did vary in area somewhat,
179.659	182.756		(H) because they did not build the dam right straight across the river,
182.756	184.641		(H) from canyon wall to canyon wa=ll,
184.641	186.624		(H) they built it in the form of an arc.
186.624	189.457		... And it's called an arch .. gravity design dam.
189.457	190.965		(H) Where the force of the water,
190.965	193.414		coming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam,
193.414	197.085		(H) and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wa=ll.
197.085	199.179		.. (H) It's a very strong design.
199.179	202.265		... They did build two concrete mixing plants here,
202.265	204.764		(H) they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day,
204.764	205.808		seven days a week,
205.808	208.020		(H) three hundred and sixty-five days a year.
208.020	209.282		(H) For two years,
209.282	211.010		.. less ... six days.
211.010	215.743		(H) Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads.
215.743	218.384		(H) Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms,
218.384	221.163		(H) the smallest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet,
221.163	224.279		(H) only filled that form up about three or four inches deep.
224.279	226.543		.. (H) So there goes that story you may have hea=rd,
226.543	228.852		(H) that there are workers buried in the concrete here.
228.852	230.385		.. Couldn't possibly happen.
230.385	233.313		.. (H) But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete,
233.313	235.110		(H) was one-inch steel water pipe.
235.110	237.513		.. (H) They came down here in this lower cofferda=m,
237.513	239.354		(H)= and they built an i=ce plant.
239.354	242.284		.. Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day.
242.284	243.653		(H) They used that ice,
243.653	244.716		to chill the water,
244.716	247.705		(H) that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete.
247.705	249.241		.. (H) As concrete ha=rdens,
249.241	250.501		or cures as we call it,
250.501	251.867		(H) it produces heat.
251.867	254.000		... The more you can control that heat,
254.000	256.033		(H) the better job of curing you're going to get.
256.033	257.910		.. (H) So they used the chilled water method,
257.910	259.011		of taking that cold water,
259.011	261.695		(H) forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete,
261.695	263.338		(H) picking up some of that heat,
263.338	265.191		(H) then carrying that heat out and away.
265.191	268.036		.. (H) They felt if they did not use a method such as this,
268.036	271.600		.. that it would've taken approximately (H) one hundred and fifty years,
271.600	274.952		for the concrete .. in the interior part of the dam (H) to cool down.
274.952	276.454		.. (H) So the system did work.
276.454	277.555		... And then it hardened,
277.555	279.138		and they remove these wooden forms,
279.138	280.185		.. <X they X> left voids.
280.185	282.380		Vertically and horizontally these forms came together,
282.380	284.248		(H) those voids were filled with grout.
284.248	285.215		Under high pressure.
285.215	287.452		... Grout being a mixture of concrete and water.
287.452	288.601		... (H) When this is done,
288.601	291.376		you have what we call a modified monolithic pour,
291.376	293.568		(H) or basically a solid block of concrete,
293.568	297.237		(H) which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base,
297.237	299.245		(H) fourty-five feet across the top,
299.245	302.187		(H) twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip,
302.187	305.229		(H) seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high.
305.229	309.063		... <MRC Six point six million tons of concrete MRC>.
309.063	313.871		... That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway (H) from New York City to San Francisco.
313.871	314.562		... O=r,
314.562	315.313		put another way,
315.313	318.459		(H) a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole.
318.459	320.785		.. (H) Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit,
320.785	323.728		(H) the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways.
323.728	326.260		(H) As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon,
326.260	327.816		you may have noticed those spillways.
327.816	328.543		(H) Here they are,
328.543	329.686		one on either side.
329.686	330.808		.. (H) What they did,
330.808	331.507		is they came in here,
331.507	334.400		and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here,
334.400	336.328		... (H) closed these gates up here,
336.328	339.126		(H) now this yellow part is forever under water.
339.126	340.500		(H) Underneath that lake out there,
340.500	341.699		and completely useless.
341.699	343.281		(H) But they did incorporate,
343.281	344.791		into the design of the dam,
344.791	346.950		(H) the balance of those diversion tunnels,
346.950	349.996		.. (H) using these outer two as spillway tunnels.
349.996	351.582		(H) Now these spillways were built,
351.582	353.106		so that the top of the spi=llway,
353.106	356.066		(H) is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam.
356.066	360.121		.. (H) This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River,
360.121	362.260		(H) rather than overtopping the dam,
362.260	364.772		(H) overtops these spillways on either side,
364.772	366.261		(H) goes into the canyon wall,
366.261	367.225		around the dam,
367.225	368.850		(H) out in the river down below.
368.850	374.900		.. (H) Each one of these spillways is capable of handling (H) two hundred th=ousand cubic feet per second of water.
374.900	377.856		.. (H) That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls.
377.856	380.358		.. (H) <X Falls X> three times higher than Niagara Falls does,
380.358	382.653		(H) time that water reaches this area down in here,
382.653	384.709		(H) it is flowing at between one hundred,
384.709	386.764		(H) and one hundred and twenty miles an hour.
386.764	389.016		... (H) Okay we have protected the spillways,
389.016	390.548		(H) now they had to get some water,
390.548	392.095		.. (H) %- into the power plant.
392.095	394.626		... What they did is they built four intake towers.
394.626	396.714		(H) Two on either side of the (H) river,
396.714	398.037		on ledges above the river,
398.037	400.754		(H) each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake,
400.754	403.271		... are three hundred and ninety-five feet high.
403.271	406.446		... Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them,
406.446	407.703		(H) one gate near the bottom,
407.703	408.784		one about half way up,
408.784	410.212		(H) to let the water in.
410.212	412.273		(H) The water then coming into the penstocks,
412.273	414.182		(H) like the one we're standing over right now.
414.182	415.438		... (H) This penstock,
415.438	417.204		you can see on either side of us out here,
417.204	418.468		(H) is three stories high,
418.468	419.879		or thirty feet in diameter,
419.879	422.963		made of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate.
422.963	425.360		.. (H) Made in section twenty-two feet long.
425.360	429.277		.. Each section weighing approximately (H) a hundred and fifty tons.
429.277	432.248		(H) Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section,
432.248	434.021		(H) using pressure pins like thi=s.
434.021	436.874		.. (H) The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon,
436.874	440.220		(H) approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch.
440.220	442.000		... (H) Okay we have the water this far,
442.000	445.162		now we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes,
445.162	446.814		(H) each one of em going to a turbine.
446.814	449.295		... (H) The force of the water turns the turbine,
449.295	451.099		which turns the rotor in the generator,
451.099	452.411		(H) and generates power.
452.411	454.564		... The water then coming on the tailrace,
454.564	455.530		we saw it up there,
455.530	458.911		(H) and going on downstream to be used at least .. six more times,
458.911	460.589		before it reaches the Mexican border,
460.589	461.963		(H) to generate more power.
461.963	465.736		.. (H) Good clean .. reusable non-polluting source of energy.
465.736	468.306		... (TSK) (H) The cost of the project.
468.306	470.889		... A hundred and seventy-five million dollars.
470.889	472.143		... I say project,
472.143	474.060		because that includes the building of the dam,
474.060	476.854		(H) the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road,
476.854	480.302		(H) the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site,
480.302	483.399		(H) and in southern California they built the All-American Canal,
483.399	485.842		(H) which takes water to the people and the crops,
485.842	487.935		.. of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys.
487.935	491.323		(H) This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest,
491.323	494.174		(H) and was paid off in fu=ll in nineteen eighty-seven.
494.174	496.063		... The people who worked here,
496.063	497.806		and they did work twenty-four hours a day,
497.806	501.208		(H) average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men.
501.208	504.748		.. (H) The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete,
504.748	506.385		(H) fourty-three hundred men.
506.385	509.793		... (H) The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour.
509.793	513.058		.. (H) Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator,
513.058	515.007		(H) at a dollar and a qu=arter an hour.
515.007	516.603		... (H) Out of each man's paycheck,
516.603	518.832		the contractor did deduct each day,
518.832	520.771		(H) a dollar and sixty cents.
520.771	522.825		(H) Because the contractor was feeding,
522.825	524.877		(H) and housing the men in Boulder City,
524.877	527.524		(H) and taking them back and forth out here to the job site.
527.524	531.020		... They did have ninety-six .. industrial deaths.
531.020	534.561		.. The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material.
534.561	536.187		(H) Basically falling rock.
536.187	538.607		... But they did have some killed by explosion,
538.607	539.777		(H) some by drowning,
539.777	540.995		some by electrocution,
540.995	543.769		(H) and other types of accidents you might expect to have.
543.769	545.348		(H) On a job of this magnitude.
545.348	547.457		... They did complete the project,
547.457	548.651		two years ahead of schedule,
548.651	549.663		and under budget.
549.663	551.606		(H) Started in early nineteen thirty-one,
551.606	553.783		(H) completed in late nineteen thirty-five.
553.783	556.139		(H) Just twelve days short .. of five years.
556.139	558.082		... (H) Do I have any questions.
558.082	560.585	AUD:	... What's this overhead pipe here X.
560.585	561.630	BEN:	(H) The overhead pipe.
561.630	562.837		(H) That's the fresh air pipe.
562.837	564.928		.. (H) ... In the summerti=me,
564.928	567.904		(H) the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees.
567.904	569.449		(H) So they bring that fresh air i=n,
569.449	572.377		(H) and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam,
572.377	575.148		(H) the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees.
575.148	578.530		(H) It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees,
578.530	580.516		(H) then they force it back throughout the dam.
580.516	582.699		(H) So it's %air-conditioning without refrigeration.
582.699	584.650		Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler.
584.650	586.590		... Any other questions.
586.590	587.344		... Yes.
587.344	588.612	AUD:	... U=h,

597.836	600.112		.. First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam.
600.112	601.070		(H) We recorded those,
601.070	602.219		but nobody down here felt em.
602.219	603.664		(H) But we do have sensors,
603.664	604.786		built right into the concrete,
604.786	606.431		(H) any movement that concrete makes,
606.431	607.860		.. is measured and recorded.
607.860	609.850		... And they had very little of it this morning.
609.850	610.593		Very little.
610.593	612.879		... Any other questions.
612.879	614.699	AUD:	... How far are you sending electricity.
614.699	615.337		California?
615.337	615.836	BEN:	.. Okay.
615.836	618.470		.. Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California,
618.470	620.321		(H) twenty-five percent of it stays in Nevada,
620.321	622.490		(H) nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona.
622.490	623.682		(H) What the government did,
623.682	626.909		is they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty.
626.909	630.226		(H) To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed.
630.226	632.697		.. (H) California was growing very fast at that time,
632.697	634.359		so they asked for and got most of the power.
634.359	635.872		.. (H) But by the same token,
635.872	636.405		Las Vegas,
636.405	638.021		about thirty-five miles up the road here,
638.021	639.192		(H) at that time,
639.192	641.474		(H) was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad.
641.474	642.504		(H) No hotels,
642.504	643.396		no casinos,
643.396	647.165		(H) we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here,
647.165	648.466		(H) and they agreed to do that.
648.466	650.096		... But that's all they get today.
650.096	653.777		(H) Because that contract is good through the year two-th=ousand and seventeen.
653.777	655.098		.. (H) So all those lights.
655.098	656.652		You see burning up there in Las Vegas,
656.652	658.674		(H) comes from power from steam plants,
658.674	660.913		(H) owned and operated by Nevada Power Company,

1275.433	1277.075		(H) You see concrete's porous.
1277.075	1278.362		(H) And because concrete's porous,
1278.362	1279.888		there's water coming through at all times.
1279.888	1281.007		(H) But that's good.
1281.007	1283.091		(H) Because if <X there're X> no moisture in concrete,
1283.091	1284.067		(H) it dries out,
1284.067	1285.190		an=d .. spalls and chips,
1285.190	1286.337		an=d .. turns to powder.
1286.337	1287.834		(H) Wouldn't make a very good dam.

1294.461	1296.504		(H) Green concrete's very strong.

1333.226	1334.527		(H) but we had to turn people away,

1392.091	1392.396	BEN:	Okay.
1392.396	1392.841		.. Folks,
1392.841	1393.545		the question is,
1393.545	1394.985		did they ever have to use the spillway.
1394.985	1395.884		.. (H) Yes.
1395.884	1397.098		Just once in the history of the dam,
1397.098	1398.382		and that was nineteen eighty-three.
1398.382	1400.016		... (H) What happened that year,
1400.016	1402.671		(H) is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains,
1402.671	1404.981		(H) .. and that was followed by rain and hot weather,
1404.981	1407.106		(H) which created a flooding condition.
1407.106	1410.135		(H) We had more water coming down the Colorado River system,
1410.135	1411.839		(H) than they could put through the power plant.
1411.839	1415.654		.. (H) Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year.
1415.654	1416.957		.. (H) On July second,
1416.957	1419.065		... water overtopped our spillways out here.
1419.065	1420.143		(H) Six days later,
1420.143	1422.053		it was going over four and a half feet high.
1422.053	1424.389		(H) And that went on for sixty-six days.
1424.389	1427.150		(H) At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam,
1427.150	1428.385		(H) or to the power plant,
1428.385	1431.491		(H) but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain,
1431.491	1433.955		(H) they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage,
1433.955	1435.261		(H) but no loss of life.
1435.261	1438.172		... But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there.
1438.172	1441.268		... That white line indicates it was going over the spillways,
1441.268	1443.383		(H) four and a half feet above floodstage.
1443.383	1444.828		(H) It gives a false impression,
1444.828	1446.745		and makes it look like the lake of the level is low.
1446.745	1448.040		Or level the lake .. of the low.
1448.040	1450.172		.. (H) Actually we're eight feet above normal,

0.000	2.180	DEBRA:	... (H) Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
2.180	4.579		(H) We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park,
4.579	6.737		and to the Hall of Champions presentation.
6.737	10.916		(H) We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon,
10.916	12.279		(H) and as we bring them out,
12.279	13.847		we'll give you the history on each one,
13.847	16.381		and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want,
16.381	17.713		and to ask questions.
17.713	40.750		...
40.750	43.295		Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions,
43.295	45.177		is our only thoroughbred stallion.
45.177	46.673		.. This is Bold Forbes.
46.673	49.527		.. (H) Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion,
49.527	51.798		and he was foaled in nineteen seventy-three.
51.798	54.198		(H) He is by the stallion Irish Castle,
54.198	56.370		and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell.
56.370	58.371		(H) He was bred by Lee Eaton,
58.371	59.678		and Red Bull Stables.
59.678	64.753		(H) This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy-four.
64.753	66.742		.. (H) Mister Estaban Tizol,
66.742	69.408		a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico,
69.408	71.115		(H) liked Bold Forbes' pedigree.
71.115	73.005		And he liked this horse so much,
73.005	75.154		(H) that he decided he was going to buy him,
75.154	76.520		no matter what the cost.
76.520	80.287		.. (H) The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars,
80.287	85.185		(H) and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico.
85.185	89.181		... (H) In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old,
89.181	91.734		(H) he went off at odds of thirty-five to one,
91.734	94.099		.. and he won that race by seventeen lengths.
94.099	96.594		... (H) He was entered into four more races,
96.594	97.500		.. he won them all,
97.500	98.735		(H) and in doing so,
98.735	101.515		he was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico.
101.515	105.545		... (H) Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico,
105.545	109.205		(H) so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition.
109.205	111.798		... (H) So in the summer of nineteen seventy-five,
111.798	113.073		he was shipped to New York,
113.073	115.076		to his new trainer Laz Barrera.
115.076	117.842		... (H) In New York he won the Freemont Stakes,
117.842	119.150		and the Saratoga Special,
119.150	120.458		before he injured his shins,
120.458	122.312		and was given the rest of the year off.
122.312	126.178		... (H) Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints,
126.178	127.828		or six furlong races.
127.828	130.682		(H) The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race,
130.682	131.815		at a mile and a quarter.
131.815	133.227		... So as a three-year-old,
133.227	136.557		Forbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby.
136.557	139.828		... (H) But his trainer had more confidence in him than that,
139.828	142.359		(H) and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle,
142.359	144.604		(H) Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby,
144.604	146.401		at odds of seventeen to one,
146.401	148.359		... one length in front of the leader,
148.359	149.374		.. Honest Pleasure.
149.374	152.840		... (H) The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes.
152.840	154.850		He cut his left hind heel during the race,
154.850	156.638		but he still managed to run third.
156.638	158.540		... (H) But when the Belmont rolled around,
158.540	159.787		he had that all healed up,
159.787	161.868		and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck.
161.868	163.180		... (H) In October,
163.180	165.555		Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap,
165.555	168.206		and again he severely bruised his right hind foot.
168.206	170.490		(H) Again he ran a very game third,
170.490	171.533		but after this race,
171.533	175.459		he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury.
175.459	178.011		(H) So he was retired to stud from the track.
178.011	183.016		... (H) Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share,
183.016	186.771		(H) and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm.
186.771	188.187		... (H) As a stallion,
188.187	190.967		Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass,
190.967	192.824		a winner of over half a million dollars,
192.824	194.046		(H) Bold Apparel,
194.046	195.575		a champion filly in Italy,
195.575	196.948		(H) Air Forbes One,
196.948	198.773		and over two-hundred other winners.
198.773	202.010		(H) .. Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars,
202.010	203.806		in just two years on the racetrack.
203.806	205.714		(H) He was in eighteen races,
205.714	207.198		and had thirteen wins,
207.198	208.897		and was never worse than third.
208.897	212.825		... (H) He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety-one.
212.825	214.753		.. (H) He is twenty-one years old,
214.753	217.305		and stands fifteen point three hands tall.
217.305	218.760		.. (H) Ladies and gentlemen,
218.760	221.515		the nineteen seventy-six Kentucky Derby winner,
221.515	222.656		.. Bold Forbes.
222.656	228.710	MANY:	.. ((APPLAUSE))
228.710	230.191	DEBRA:	.. Does anyone have any questions,
230.191	232.128		while we're waiting for the next horse to come out.
232.128	233.985		... Questions?
233.985	234.978		... Okay,
234.978	235.641		while we're waiting,
235.641	237.794		I'll just call everyone's attention to this horse,
237.794	238.923		@I @don't @know if everyone can see him,
238.923	241.641		(H) %over here in this paddock on= the right,
241.641	243.519		(H) this is Sergeant Pepper Feature,
243.519	243.768		and,
243.768	244.968		he's usually in our show,
244.968	245.115		but,
245.115	246.799		because Bold Forbes is up here today,
246.799	247.010		he --
247.010	247.728		We kicked him out.
247.728	250.165		We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions,
250.165	251.665		(H) and only five stalls.
251.665	253.637		So we could only have five at a time in the show.
253.637	254.315		(H)= Um,
254.315	258.314		Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse,
258.314	258.957		(H) and,
258.957	260.368		at the time of his retirement,
260.368	262.880		he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history,
262.880	265.843		(H) and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars.
265.843	266.456		... So,
266.456	267.708		on your way out .. today,
267.708	269.223		you might wanna just take a look over there,
269.223	270.449		and say hi to Sergeant Pepper.
270.449	295.850		...
295.850	297.809		And there's Bold Forbes looking out the window.
297.809	299.021		<@ If anybody can see him,
299.021	299.715		he's right there,
299.715	301.073		(H) watching the show @>.
301.073	315.574		...
315.574	319.796		(H) Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions,
319.796	321.132		that is not a racehorse.
321.132	322.718		... This is Imperator.
322.718	326.015		And he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse.
326.015	327.022		... (H) Perry,
327.022	328.242		as he is commonly called,
328.242	330.177		is by the sire Supreme Sultan,
330.177	333.322		who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park.
333.322	335.612		.. (H) He is out of the dam Empress Wing,
335.612	338.172		.. and she is by the great sire Wing Commander.
338.172	342.485		(H) Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator.
342.485	345.294		.. (H) Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois,
345.294	347.450		(H) and he was purchased there as a two-year-old,
347.450	348.141		by his owner,
348.141	349.520		Doctor Geraldine Meanor,
349.520	351.118		(H) and then sent to his trainer,
351.118	351.838		Don Harris,
351.838	353.182		of Simpsonville Kentucky.
353.182	357.305		.. (H) Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared.
357.305	359.450		(H) They both had the same birthday.
359.450	361.123		(H) And as the years went past,
361.123	363.219		and Imperator's popularity increased,
363.219	368.766		(H) Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did.
368.766	373.364		... (H) Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits,
373.364	374.888		.. the walk trot and canter,
374.888	376.546		(H) plus two manmade gaits,
376.546	377.876		the slow gait and the rack.
377.876	381.673		... (H) The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed.
381.673	387.082		... Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times.
387.082	390.354		(H) And he has also been reserve world champion five times.
390.354	392.290		... (H) He was shown eighty-five times,
392.290	394.167		at forty-four shows around the country.
394.167	396.137		(H) He has sixty-eight blue ribbons,
396.137	397.185		thirteen seconds,
397.185	399.854		and very rarely was he ever worse than third.
399.854	402.183		... (H) Now the first time Perry was shown,
402.183	404.396		he was very wild and inexperienced,
404.396	407.354		and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring.
407.354	411.005		(H) And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions.
411.005	413.226		... (H) But the second time he was shown,
413.226	414.608		he had improved so much,
414.608	417.955		(H) the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back,
417.955	419.950		.. with all four feet stuck up in the air.
419.950	424.623		... (H) Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail.
424.623	426.608		.. (H) At the highlight of his career,
426.608	428.924		(H) .. Perry's tail was fourteen feet long,
428.924	431.146		and could be wrapped completely around his body.
431.146	434.076		... If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry,
434.076	437.052		(H) you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail.
437.052	438.657		.. (H) When Perry was retired,
438.657	440.152		Mister Harris cut his tail,
440.152	441.768		to make it easier to care for,
441.768	446.670		(H) and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail.
446.670	450.175		.. (H) Well Perry had been retired here for about two years,
450.175	452.513		(H) but had never had a formal retirement.
452.513	454.965		(H) So in August of nineteen ninety-one,
454.965	459.208		Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky.
459.208	460.484		.. (H) That night,
460.484	461.905		Imperator and his trainer,
461.905	463.005		Mister Don Harris,
463.005	464.295		(H) stepped into the ring,
464.295	465.577		one last time together,
465.577	470.450		(H) and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen-eighties.
470.450	472.635		... (H) Perry is now twenty years old,
472.635	475.000		and stands fifteen point three hands tall.
475.000	476.385		(H) Ladies and gentlemen,
476.385	478.316		the four-time world grand champion,
478.316	479.207		.. Imperator.
479.207	485.654	MANY:	.. ((APPLAUSE))
485.654	487.713	DEBRA:	.. Does anyone have any questions,
487.713	487.947		while we're --
487.947	488.401		Yes.
488.401	492.198	AUD:	... What's the average age that a horse lives to.
492.198	494.398	DEBRA:	(H) A good average is about twenty-eight,
494.398	495.988		if they're well taken care of.
495.988	496.336		Um,
496.336	498.617		a lotta horses will live into their thirties.
498.617	501.865		... (H) A- a good way to compare horse ages to humans,
501.865	503.429		is to multiply by three.
503.429	504.690		... And --
504.690	504.986		Except,
504.986	506.365		I think the oldest liv- --
506.365	506.577		Oh,
506.577	507.521		oldest horse on record,
507.521	508.964		I think in the Guinness Book of World Records,
508.964	510.321		was sixty-two @.
510.321	515.400		... So don't multiply that .. that one by three.
515.400	516.260		<@ That would be what,
516.260	518.494		(H) a hundred and eighty-six .. <X or something X> (H) @>.
518.494	520.179		.. Are there any other questions?
520.179	522.180		... No?
522.180	525.384		... If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like,
525.384	527.411		when he had his fourteen-foot tail,
527.411	528.070		(H) um,
528.070	529.779		when you come into the visitor center,
529.779	531.664		I don't know if- if .. anybody noticed this,
531.664	533.833		(H) there's a TV monitor right after you --
533.833	535.760		.. Where you b=uy your tickets when you come in,
535.760	536.349		and you look up,
536.349	536.881		and there's a --
536.881	540.737		(H) An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there,
540.737	541.604		(H) and uh,
541.604	543.904		there's a little clip of Imperator on there,
543.904	545.347		and I think he's slowgaiting,
545.347	547.206		.. which was his most .. beautiful gait,
547.206	547.895		.. (H) um,
547.895	550.083		and you can see his fourteen-foot tail up there,
550.083	550.442		and that was- --
550.442	551.472		It was really beautiful.
551.472	556.602		.. (SNIFF) ...
556.602	557.375		Do you have a question?
557.375	558.347		... Back there?
558.347	560.886	AUD:	... He wants to know how you say hi to a horse.
560.886	561.855	DEBRA:	... Um,
561.855	563.114		... just say hi @.
563.114	564.361		.. You can just say hi,
564.361	564.580		and they- --
564.580	565.631		And you can say their name,
565.631	566.863		.. cause they know their names.
566.863	569.085		... So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator,
569.085	569.347		just --
569.347	570.483		.. And he goes by Perry,
570.483	572.444		so if you just come up to him and say <VOX hi Perry VOX>,
572.444	573.627		he'll know you're talking to him.
573.627	581.590		... (H) Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions,
581.590	582.830		this is Forego.
582.830	586.147		... (H) Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli,
586.147	589.088		.. and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda.
589.088	592.660		... He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky.
592.660	594.801		.. (H) Due to Forego's large size,
594.801	596.534		he was not raced as a two-year-old,
596.534	599.662		(H) because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature.

602.485	606.518		And he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventy-three Kentucky Derby.
606.518	611.542		... (H) Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby,
611.542	613.605		(H) on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown.
613.605	617.291		... (H) Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day,
617.291	619.191		(H) But he did run a fine race.
619.191	621.527		... (H) He was involved in a bumping incident,
621.527	623.485		as the horses left the starting gate.
623.485	624.976		(H) He recovered from that,
624.976	626.378		.. but he and another horse,
626.378	627.052		Our Native,
627.052	628.923		(H) bumped through the entire stretch,
628.923	631.558		and both horses ended in a photo finish for third.
631.558	633.499		... After the steward's inquiry,
633.499	635.313		(H) Forego had to settle for fourth,
635.313	638.345		.. because the steward said the bumping was all his fault.
638.345	640.644		... (H) The older Forego got,
640.644	641.723		the better he got,
641.723	645.205		and he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race.
645.205	649.229		(H) He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century.
649.229	652.204		... (H) Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha- --
652.204	654.271		Forego had to carry a lot of extra weight,
654.271	656.842		(H) over whatever distance he was asked to run,
656.842	659.725		(H) in order to give the other horses more of a chance.
659.725	662.207		... (H) He was in thirty-four handicap events,
662.207	663.253		and thirty times,
663.253	664.822		he was the high-weighted horse.
664.822	668.026		... (H) The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory,
668.026	669.979		was a hundred and thirty-seven pounds.
669.979	673.438		(H) And that was in the nineteen seventy-six Marlboro Cup.
673.438	675.673		... (H) Well before the race it had rained,
675.673	676.973		and the track was sloppy,
676.973	680.467		(H) and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet.
680.467	682.401		... So as the field turned for home,
682.401	684.528		it looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten,
684.528	687.217		some ten lengths behind the leader Honest Pleasure.
687.217	690.734		... (H) Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year,
690.734	693.126		... He was three years younger than Forego,
693.126	696.145		(H) and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight.
696.145	697.871		... But determined to win,
697.871	700.209		(H) Forego made up that last quarter mile,
700.209	701.847		in twenty-two seconds flat,
701.847	704.093		(H) and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire.
704.093	705.910		... The jockey that rode Forego,
705.910	707.384		the great Willy Shoemaker,
707.384	709.279		(H) said there wasn't a horse alive,
709.279	711.251		that could've beaten Forego on that day.
711.251	713.706		... (H) Forego was named horse of the year,
713.706	715.018		three consecutive years,
715.018	717.969		in nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and seventy-six.
717.969	720.314		(H) And he has also been champion sprinter,
720.314	722.373		as well as champion handicap horse.
722.373	726.433		... (H) An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive.
726.433	728.719		(H) And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards,
728.719	730.606		which is more than any other horse.
730.606	733.389		... Forego retired in nineteen seventy-eight,
733.389	736.303		(H) with earnings of over one point nine million dollars,
736.303	739.419		which made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time,
739.419	740.393		behind Kelso.
740.393	744.518		... (H) He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventy-nine.
744.518	748.394		... (H) Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions,
748.394	750.164		(H) he is twenty-four years old,
750.164	754.311		and stands a very impressive (H) seventeen point one hands tall.
754.311	755.732		... Ladies and gentlemen,
755.732	757.235		the great handicap horse,
757.235	758.083		... Forego.

840.846	842.592		... and and they put him down.
842.592	853.154		... (H) Our next horse to come out today,
853.154	855.833		is our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here,
855.833	858.530		(H) and you'll see that he's a lot smaller than Forego.
858.530	860.335		... This is John Henry.
860.335	864.454		... (H) John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings.
864.454	867.012		(H) He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers,
867.012	869.547		who was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either.
869.547	872.245		.. (H) And he is out of the brood mare Once Double,
872.245	873.988		(H) who outside of John Henry,
873.988	876.075		had very little success as a brood mare.
876.075	879.775		... (H) John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy-five,
879.775	882.222		at Golden Chance Farm in Paris Kentucky.
882.222	885.332		.. (H) The farm kept John until nineteen seventy-six,
885.332	888.275		when he was consigned to the Keenenland January Mixed Sale.
888.275	891.645		.. (H) Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse,
891.645	896.021		(H) it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter.
896.021	898.298		... (H) So because of his small size,
898.298	899.522		his lack of pedigree,
899.522	900.382		but most of all,
900.382	902.161		his very nasty disposition,
902.161	904.885		(H) John brought only eleven hundred dollars.
904.885	907.220		... (H) And from the time of this first sale,
907.220	909.048		until May nineteen seventy-eight,
909.048	910.228		(H) John was sold,
910.228	911.628		over half a dozen times,
911.628	913.052		because nobody wanted him,
913.052	914.958		(H) and nobody could get along with him.
914.958	917.561		... (H) But in May of nineteen seventy-eight,
917.561	918.859		a New York businessman,
918.859	919.612		Sam Rubin,
919.612	922.034		(H) decided it would be fun to own a racehorse.
922.034	925.096		.. (H) Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses,
925.096	927.174		(H) and the only thing he knew about racing,
927.174	928.861		is where the valet parking was.
928.861	930.796		... (H) So he bought John Henry,
930.796	931.837		over the telephone,
931.837	932.681		sight unseen,
932.681	934.521		for twenty-five thousand dollars.
934.521	936.533		.. (H) John then went to New York,
936.533	938.484		to his first trainer Bobby Donato.
938.484	940.789		.. (H) In his very first New York start,
940.789	943.292		he won a twenty-five thousand dollar claiming race,
943.292	943.979		over the dirt,
943.979	945.297		by one and a half lengths.
945.297	947.431		.. (H) His next race was on turf,
947.431	949.250		(H) which John preferred to run on,
949.250	950.238		and again he won,
950.238	952.144		but this time by fourteen lengths.
952.144	956.616		... (H) Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did,
956.616	958.788		(H) advised him to send John west,
958.788	960.837		.. where the turf racing was more lucrative,
960.837	961.829		more competitive,
961.829	963.276		and run all year long.
963.276	965.501		... So in late nineteen seventy-nine,
965.501	966.845		(H) John headed west,
966.845	967.846		to his new trainer,
967.846	968.969		.. Ronald McAnally.
968.969	970.560		... (H) In nineteen eighty,
970.560	972.965		John won over nine-hundred thousand dollars.
972.965	974.601		.. (H) In nineteen eighty-one,
974.601	976.906		John won the very first Arlington Million,
976.906	979.384		(H) over one point seven million dollars,
979.384	981.003		and was voted horse of the year.
981.003	982.776		.. (H) In nineteen eighty-two,
982.776	983.680		and nineteen eighty-three,
983.680	984.952		John had some injuries,
984.952	986.371		and only won four races,
986.371	989.249		(H) but they mounted up to one point two million dollars.
989.249	993.739		... (H) And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nine-year-old,
993.739	997.964		(H) folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age.
997.964	1000.839		... (H) Well John did lose his first race that year,
1000.839	1004.121		(H) but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack.
1004.121	1006.163		... (H) He won six graded stakes,
1006.163	1008.752		including a repeat victory in the Arlington Million,
1008.752	1011.081		(H) over two point three million dollars,
1011.081	1012.975		and again was voted horse of the year.
1012.975	1015.920		... (H) When John was retired in nineteen eighty-four,
1015.920	1018.337		he was the world's richest thoroughbred in history.
1018.337	1021.482		(H) With earnings over six point five million dollars.
1021.482	1024.246		... (H) Since then Alisheba has beat his record,
1024.246	1026.126		but John is still the richest gelding.
1026.126	1028.572		... (H) John holds seven Eclipse Awards,
1028.572	1030.617		which is second only to Forego's eight,
1030.617	1033.989		(H) and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety.
1033.989	1037.242		... John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade,
1037.242	1038.388		for the nineteen eighties.
1038.388	1041.352		... (H) John has been retired here for eight years now.
1041.352	1043.065		(H) He is nineteen years old,
1043.065	1044.707		and stands a very small=,
1044.707	1046.980		(H) fifteen point one hands tall.

1154.425	1159.690		... (H) Our last horse to come out today,
1159.690	1161.583		is our standardbred representative,
1161.583	1162.538		Rambling Willie.
1162.538	1165.598		.. (H) A standardbred races at a trot or a pace,
1165.598	1167.368		and they pull a sulky with a driver.
1167.368	1168.820		... (H) Willie is a pacer.
1168.820	1171.777		... (H) Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana,
1171.777	1174.235		and he began his racing career as a to-year-old,
1174.235	1175.830		for his owner Raymond Gibson.
1175.830	1179.257		(H) He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds,
1179.257	1181.152		(H) so he did show some promise,
1181.152	1184.290		but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a three-year-old.
1184.290	1187.709		... (H) Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver,
1187.709	1189.001		Mister Robert Farrington,
1189.001	1190.663		for fifteen thousand dollars.
1190.663	1192.489		(H) But not long after he bought him,
1192.489	1195.916		Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse,
1195.916	1198.888		(H) so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio,
1198.888	1200.039		Mister Paul Sebert,
1200.039	1204.062		(H) and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie.
1204.062	1206.956		... (H) Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before,
1206.956	1208.791		(H) and his luck had been pretty bad.
1208.791	1210.656		.. (H) The first horse he owned died,
1210.656	1212.179		before it made it to the racetrack,
1212.179	1214.790		(H) and the second horse he owned made it to the races,
1214.790	1215.895		and she ran and ran,
1215.895	1217.389		but just couldn't win anything,
1217.389	1218.305		so he sold her.
1218.305	1219.737		.. (H) And after he sold her,
1219.737	1223.293		she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner.
1223.293	1226.950		... (H) Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though,
1226.950	1229.565		(H) and things didn't start off so well there either.
1229.565	1232.044		... Willie was being raced at county fairs,
1232.044	1233.422		in Ohio and Indiana,
1233.422	1235.950		(H) and was being beaten on a regular basis.
1235.950	1240.796		... (H) Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday,
1240.796	1243.074		(H) and he was trying to decide what to get her.
1243.074	1246.318		.. (H) So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian,
1246.318	1248.009		would be the other half of Willie.
1248.009	1251.110		... (H) Well Vivian was a very religious person,
1251.110	1254.627		(H) and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church.
1254.627	1256.364		.. (H) So Vivian decided,
1256.364	1259.159		that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack,
1259.159	1261.170		(H) she would donate ten percent,
1261.170	1262.853		of her half of Willie's earnings,
1262.853	1264.194		to her father's church.
1264.194	1267.106		... (H) And that's when Willie's racing career took off.

1268.069	1269.770	DEBRA:	(H) Because of his success,
1269.770	1271.117		and his ties to the church,
1271.117	1272.721		.. there was a book written about Willie,
1272.721	1273.256		titled,
1273.256	1274.340		(H) Rambling Willie,

1275.763	1277.831		.. (H) In order to promote his book,
1277.831	1279.795		.. Willie would hold autograph sessions.
1279.795	1282.063		.. (H) One day when Willie was in New York,
1282.063	1284.878		he had an autograph session at Macy's department store.
1284.878	1286.642		(H) And he was such a hit there,

1301.122	1303.478		(H) He won a hundred and twenty-eight times,
